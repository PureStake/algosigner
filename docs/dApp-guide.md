# Decentralized Applications

As a browser extension, AlgoSigner opens the door for developers to build DeFi applications on Algorand by providing a secure way to add transaction capabilities. This enables developers to initiate transactions and accept ALGOs seamlessly, without jeopardizing the security of their users’ secrets.

For end users, AlgoSigner also makes it easy to use Algorand-based applications on the web. Simply create or import your Algorand account, visit a compatible dApp, and approve or deny transactions — all from within your browser.

DApp users can trust AlgoSigner to:

- Securely store and encrypt account secrets
- Authorize transactions without giving dApps direct access to their keys
- Sign and approve transactions when using dApps
