# ![AlgoSigner](media/algosigner-wallet-banner-3.png)

An open-source Algorand wallet browser extension that permits dApp communication for signing Algorand transactions — available for Chrome initially.

## Chrome Extension Store

The extension is available on the [Chrome Extension Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/algosigner/kmmolakhbgdlpkjkcjkebenjheonagdm)

_This is the preferred solution for end-users, updates will be automatically installed after review by the extension store_

Developers working with dApps may also install directly from the release package, or by downloading the project and building it.

## 1.1.0 Update

The latest release introduces several key new features for users and dApp developers.

### Asset Support in the UI

Assets you own have always been displayed in the AlgoSigner UI, but we have added additional capabilities. Now you may search for new assets, opt-in to receive them, and transfer them right in the AlgoSigner UI.

### Asset Support for dApps

dApps were previously able to send in basic asset transactions to be signed by AlgoSigner. Support has now been added for all asset transaction types with accompanying UI notices.

- Clawback added
- Destroy capability allowed for `acfg`
- Close-to supported in `axfer`

### Application Transaction Support for dApps

dApp developers may now send in application transactions to be signed. This support is new and subject to change in subsequent releases. Please read the updated [dApp Integration Guide](docs/dApp-integration.md) for instructions on working with these transaction types.

### Additional dApp support

- Support has been enabled for `close-to` transactions.
- Transaction validation errors will now provide more detailed messages on causes

### UI Transactions

With the addition of support for `close-to` transactions, new warning messages will display in the UI when dApps send in pay transactions that are potentially dangerous.

The signing window will also now better reflect the ledger for which the dApp is asking the user to sign a transaction. A new label is present in dark blue for TestNet and orange for MainNet.

### Sample dApp and dApp Tests

- Signing app — New sample dApp for [demonstrating transaction signing](https://purestake.github.io/algosigner-dapp-example/tx-test/signTesting.html)
- Updates to the [existing sample dApp](https://purestake.github.io/algosigner-dapp-example/) demonstrating pending lookup and asset search

## Decentralized Applications

As a browser extension, AlgoSigner opens the door for developers to build DeFi applications on Algorand by providing a secure way to add transaction capabilities. This enables developers to initiate transactions and accept ALGOs seamlessly, without jeopardizing the security of their users’ secrets.

For end users, AlgoSigner also makes it easy to use Algorand-based applications on the web. Simply create or import your Algorand account, visit a compatible dApp, and approve or deny transactions — all from within your browser.

DApp users can trust AlgoSigner to:

- Securely store and encrypt account secrets
- Authorize transactions without giving dApps direct access to their keys
- Sign and approve transactions when using dApps

### Developing a dApp

- Read [dApp Integration Guide](docs/dApp-integration.md)
- Read [Sample dApp project](https://github.com/PureStake/algosigner-dapp-example)
- Try [Interactive dApp](https://purestake.github.io/algosigner-dapp-example/)

## Project Structure

There are multiple packages in the project that combine to build the overall extension. Each component package is designed so that its functionality doesn't require the rebuild of other packages and will be combined to build the deployable extension.

## Build and Install

The ./dist/ folder is the only required folder to install the extension yourself from code and must be built.

- Clone the repository locally
- Run `npm install` in the root folder
- Run `npm run build` in the root folder — this creates the `dist` folder
- Open Chrome browser — go to `chrome://extensions/`
- Enable developer mode
- Select `Load Unpacked` and choose the just created `dist` folder
- AlgoSigner is now installed and available
