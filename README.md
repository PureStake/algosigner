# ![AlgoSigner](media/algosigner-wallet-banner-3.png)

An open-source, security audited, Algorand wallet browser extension that lets users approve and sign transactions that are generated by Algorand dApp applications â€” available for Chrome.

## Chrome Extension Store

The extension is available on the [Chrome Extension Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/algosigner/kmmolakhbgdlpkjkcjkebenjheonagdm)

_This is the preferred solution for end-users, updates will be automatically installed after review by the extension store_

Developers working with dApps may also install directly from the release package, or by downloading the project and building it.

## 1.10.0 Release

### Main updates
As part of the process of supporting the [Algorand Foundations ARCs](https://arc.algorand.foundation/), in 1.10.0 a number of non-breaking additions have been made to support how dApps will work with AlgoSigner. In time, the existing legacy features will be deprecated. 

- A new top level object, `window.algorand` is made available and can be accessed by the dapp to make calls to AlgoSigner. The existing `window.AlgoSigner` object remains but will be deprecated over the next year. 
- An updated connection flow and address discovery process for dApps is in place, using `algorand.enable()`. **The existing connection flow persists but will be deprecated over the next 3-6 months.**
- Dapps may also now request for AlgoSigner to directly post signed transactions to the network and not return the signed blob to the dApp for handling. 
- Additional documentation regarding the use of `authAddr` for signing transactions with rekeyed accounts.

An interactive transition guide will be available soon to aid in the migration of existing functionalities.
