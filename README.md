# ![AlgoSigner](media/algosigner-wallet-banner-3.png)

An open-source, security audited, Algorand wallet browser extension that lets users approve and sign transactions that are generated by Algorand dApp applications â€” available for Chrome.

## Chrome Extension Store

The extension is available on the [Chrome Extension Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/algosigner/kmmolakhbgdlpkjkcjkebenjheonagdm)

_This is the preferred solution for end-users, updates will be automatically installed after review by the extension store_

Developers working with dApps may also install directly from the release package, or by downloading the project and building it.

### Important

As part of the process of supporting the [Algorand Foundations ARCs](https://arc.algorand.foundation/), in 1.10.0, a number of non-breaking additions have been made to support how dApps will work with AlgoSigner. In time, the existing legacy features will be deprecated.

An interactive transition guide is available [here](https://purestake.github.io/algosigner-dapp-example/arcTransitionGuide.html) to aid in the migration of existing functionalities.

## 1.11.0 Release

### Main updates

- Multiple improvements to Custom Networks including:
  - Automatic fetching of genesis ID and hashes for the user.
  - Achieved full compatibility with `enable()` calls.
  - Other UI/UX changes.
- Updated a lot of error messages and data structures to better communicate the causes of errors.

### Other updates and bugfixes:
- Connecting to a dApp using an `enable()` call while logged out no longer closes the connection window after inputting your password.
- Improved validations for `keyreg` transactions regarding nonParticipation.
- Improved validations for `acfg` transactions regarding the distinctions between 'Create', 'Config' and 'Destroy'.
- Fixed account permission bug on `enable()` calls.
- SDK support updated to v2.0.0.
